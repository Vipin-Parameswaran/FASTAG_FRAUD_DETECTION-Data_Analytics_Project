# FASTAG_FRAUD_DETECTION-Data_Analytics_Project
## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a robust machine learning-based fraud detection
system for Fastag transactions. Fastag is an electronic toll collection system in India that uses
RFID technology to make toll payments directly from a prepaid account linked to a userâ€™s vehicle.
As digital transactions become more prevalent, the risk of fraudulent activities also increases. This
project aims to leverage machine learning classification techniques to accurately identify fraudulent
transactions, thereby ensuring the security and integrity of Fastag transactions.

## Dataset Description
The dataset comprises various features related to Fastag transactions, including transaction details,
vehicle information, geographical location, and transaction amounts. 
The key features are:
##### Transaction_ID: Unique identifier for each transaction.
##### Timestamp: Date and time of the transaction.
#### Vehicle_Type: Type of vehicle involved in the transaction.
#### FastagID: Unique identifier for Fastag.
#### TollBoothID: Identifier for the toll booth.
#### Lane_Type: Type of lane used for the transaction.
#### Vehicle_Dimensions: Dimensions of the vehicle.
#### Transaction_Amount: Amount associated with the transaction.
#### Amount_paid: Amount paid for the transaction.
#### Geographical_Location: Location details of the transaction.
#### Vehicle_Speed: Speed of the vehicle during the transaction.
#### Vehicle_Plate_Number: License plate number of the vehicle.
#### Fraud_indicator: Binary indicator of fraudulent activity (target variable)
